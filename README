Installation
------------
The go tool is probably the best method of installing goncurses.

go get "code.google.com/p/goncurses"

Alternatively you could use mercurial to install goncurses.


Usage
-----

import "code.google.com/p/goncurses"


NOTES
-----

No functions which operate only on stdscr have been implemented because 
it makes little sense to do so in a Go implementation. Stdscr is treated the
same as any other window.

Whenever possible, versions of ncurses functions which could potentially
have a buffer overflow, like the getstr() family of functions, have not been
implemented. Instead, only the mvwgetnstr() and wgetnstr() are used.


TODO
----

 * complete core library implementation
 * complete form library implementation
 * complete menu library implementation
 * better handling of variable input
 

See the following matrix for a basic overview of each module's completion
status:

    Module | Complete
    -----------------
     Core  |   24%
     Form  |   41%
     Menu  |   78%
     Panel |  100%
